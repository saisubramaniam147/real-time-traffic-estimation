Worked on a project at the IIT Madras on Real Time Traffic Estimation Using Live Video and Image Processing with my classmates - Yeshwanth Raja, Shyam Ravichandran and A Vignesh.

Tenure of project was from 09.06.2014 to 01.07.2014. During this period of 3 weeks we worked on image processing for detecting and analysing the vehicular traffic, based on the principle of using images captured from real time footage from cameras positioned at various traffic junctions across the Chennai city.

Google and other sources use crowd source information for obtaining the traffic status, our data was live video feeds transmitted from the source (the road under observation) to the IITM server. We were able to detect and estimate the presence and the amount of traffic present on the road using openCV.

The goal of the project was to categorize the traffic present on the road into low, medium or high factors. An extension of the application also gave an approximate percentage of the road occupied by vehicles.

The application can also predict traffic at different times of the day, including night, by adjusting a brightness threshold value. Initially used the system clock to automatically update the threshold; a simple brightness sensor attached to the camera can also serve as an alternative to handle the threshold update.

This system was tested on three different cameras, each focussing on three different locations of the city. A comparsion was made with Google Maps and Waze on the traffic status.
